Sociedad Deportiva Eibar is a Spanish football club based in Eibar, Gipuzkoa, in the autonomous Basque Country.

Founded on 30 November 1940, the team currently plays in La Liga, having been promoted to the top tier of Spanish football for the first time in 2014. They also participated in 26 Segunda División seasons (a spell in the 1950s, and most of the 1990s and 2000s), spending the rest of their history competing at lower levels.

The team plays in claret and blue shirts with blue shorts (originating from the kit of FC Barcelona)[4] and holds home games at the Ipurua Municipal Stadium. SD Eibar is a fan-owned club, with more than 10,000 shareholders from 69 countries all over the world. Until SD Huesca qualified for the top flight in 2018, the club was considered the smallest to have played in Spain's top division, and its stadium had the lowest capacity of any La Liga teams. Although Eibar is the sole professional club of its town, it contests several Basque derbies with other clubs from the region.

Eibar is the only football club which has the quality certificate UNE-EN-ISO 9001.
