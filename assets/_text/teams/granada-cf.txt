Granada Club de Fútbol, or simply Granada, is a Spanish football club in Granada, in the autonomous community of Andalusia. Founded on 6 April 1931, it plays in the La Liga. The club plays its home matches at the Estadio Nuevo Los Cármenes.

Granada was the third Andalusian football team after Betis and Sevilla to compete in La Liga, in 1941–42. The team is located at position 24 of the historical points classification of the First Division, where it has participated in 20 seasons and finished in sixth place twice. Granada was Copa del Rey runner-up in 1959.

Granada Club de Fútbol was founded on 14 April 1931, originally as Recreativo de Granada; the first president was Julio López Fernández. The first football match was played against Deportivo Jaén, which resulted in a 2–1 victory. The first goal in the match, and in the club's history, was scored by Antonio Bombillar. In the 1931–32 season, the club won the Tercera Regional – Región Sur championship.

After several promotions, in 1941–42 the club made its La Liga debut. From here until the '80s, it alternated between that category and Segunda División, with its golden age coming during the '70s, with eight top flight seasons, which included a career-best two sixth league places (1971–72, 1973–74).

In 1959 Granada achieved its greatest sports landmark, being runner-up of the Copa del Generalísimo (later Copa del Rey). In the final, played at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, the team lost to Barcelona 4–1.

In the 1980s, Granada had some brief appearances in the second division, but it spent most seasons in Segunda División B, dropping another level in 2002–03, due to non-payment to its players. After four seasons in the fourth division, former Real Madrid president Lorenzo Sanz, along with his son Paco, arrived at the club. With their help, the Andalusian side was again promoted to the third category but got itself into serious financial trouble.

In 2006–07, Granada played in Group IV of the third level after four seasons in Tercera. Three years later, in July 2009, the club was in such financial difficulty that it was on the brink of closing. The solution to the crisis came with the signing of a partnership agreement with Udinese Calcio, with the Spaniards incorporating large numbers of players contracted to the Italian club as well as receiving its youth players and reserves as part of the agreement. At the end of the season, Granada won its group then promoted in the play-offs, returning to the second division after 22 years.

In 2010–11, Granada finished in fifth position, with most of the players loaned by Udinese still on board. On 18 June 2011, the club became the first winner of the promotion play-offs – a different system was used from 1985 to 1999 – after successively defeating Celta de Vigo (1–1, penalty shootout) and Elche (1–1 on aggregate, away goals rule), thus returning to the top division after a 35-year absence.

Back in the top-flight after such a long absence, it was always going to be difficult. By the end of the 2011–12 season, Granada managed to survive though, finishing in 17th position.

After surviving in the top flight for six seasons, Granada was relegated in 2016-17 after being defeated by Real Sociedad. After spending two years in the Segunda Division, Granada was promoted to the La Liga after a 1-1 away draw against RCD Mallorca.
